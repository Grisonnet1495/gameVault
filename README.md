# gameVault

gameVault is a game library application built in C# with WPF for Windows x64.
It was developed as part of a second-year C# course at HEPL (Belgium).

This project is not intended for official release, so it may contain bugs.

Please note that this is our first project using C# and WPF, so the appâ€™s usability might not be optimal.
Please also note that the export and backup functionality does not include the game image.

You are free to compile and modify this project for personal use, as long as you credit the original developers.
